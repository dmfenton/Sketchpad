description: Start dev servers (server + web)
---

Start the development servers using `make dev-web` (Python server + Vite web app).

Run `make dev-web` in foreground. This will:
1. Kill any existing processes on ports 8000 and 5173
2. Start the Python server on :8000
3. Start the Vite web app on :5173

The user can Ctrl+C to stop both servers cleanly.

If servers are stuck, run `make dev-stop` first to force-kill by port.
