## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `scripts/ws-client.py` - Terminal WebSocket client for testing agent interactions (view, test, watch, start, pause, resume, nudge, clear, status commands)

### Changed

- Agent uses Claude Haiku in dev mode for cost reduction, Opus in production
- Agent loop only runs on explicit user actions (nudge, resume, new_canvas) - no automatic retries

## [1.28.0] - 2026-01-19

### Added

- `sign_canvas` tool: Agent can sign completed pieces with "Code Monet" signature in elegant cursive script
- `name_piece` tool: Agent can give evocative titles to completed artwork before saving
- Piece titles stored in gallery entries and displayed with artwork
- Agent now follows a finishing ritual: sign the canvas, name the piece, then mark done

## [1.26.2] - 2026-01-19

## [1.26.1] - 2026-01-19

### Fixed

- Docker Compose image reference now includes repository name (`/drawing-agent`) for correct ECR pull

  - Merged `status` + `paused` → `agent_state` (single message for agent state)
  - Merged `piece_count` + `piece_complete` → `piece_state` (single message with completed flag)
  - Separated `GalleryEntry` (metadata only) from `SavedCanvas` (includes strokes)
  - Removed redundant `thinking` message (content already streamed via `thinking_delta`)
- Removed unused code: `executor.py`, `PenMessage`, `ExecutionState`

### Fixed

- In-progress agent strokes now render with their actual color, width, and opacity in paint mode

## [1.20.0] - 2026-01-16
