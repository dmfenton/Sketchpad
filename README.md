# Code Monet

An autonomous AI artist powered by Claude that creates drawings, observes its work, and iterates—with humans as creative collaborators.

## What Is This?

A drawing machine with genuine creative agency. The AI comes up with its own ideas, writes code to generate drawings, watches the results appear on a shared canvas, and decides what to do next. Humans can intervene anytime—draw on the canvas, nudge the agent with suggestions, or just watch it work.

## Technical Highlights

### AI Agent Architecture

Built on **Anthropic's Claude Agent SDK** with a custom tool ecosystem:

- **Sandboxed code execution**: Drawing commands run in isolated MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers
- **Multi-turn reasoning loops**: Agent sees canvas state, generates paths, observes results, iterates
- **Streaming thought process**: Real-time delivery of agent thinking to clients—full transparency into creative decisions
- **Style-aware generation**: Two distinct modes (pen plotter vs. expressive paint) with different constraints and palettes

The agent generates **path commands** (SVG paths, cubic beziers, polylines) rather than pixels—resolution-independent and infinitely scalable.

### Real-Time Collaborative Canvas

**WebSocket architecture** for real-time rendering:

- Event-driven orchestration with `asyncio.Event` (no polling)
- Per-user isolated workspaces with thread-safe multi-user support
- Graceful reconnection with full state recovery
- JWT authentication with distributed tracing correlation

**Path interpolation engine**:

- Trapezoidal velocity profiles with easing (accelerate → cruise → decelerate)
- Pen plotter motion simulation (pen-up travel, servo settling delays)
- Client-side animation decoupled from agent execution

### Infrastructure & DevOps

**Terraform-managed AWS deployment**:

| Resource   | Purpose                                              |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| EC2 + EBS  | Compute with persistent storage, automated snapshots |
| ECR        | Container registry with lifecycle policies           |
| SES        | Magic link auth with DKIM, SPF, DMARC                |
| Route 53   | DNS management                                       |
| X-Ray      | Distributed tracing with client span correlation     |
| CloudWatch | Alarms and monitoring                                |

**CI/CD pipeline**:

- Tag-based releases via GitHub Actions
- Docker builds with multi-stage optimization
- Watchtower auto-deployment (30-second rollouts)
- Deployment verification before marking releases complete

### Mobile Deployment

**iOS via Expo + Fastlane**:

- Automated TestFlight builds on version tags
- iOS Universal Links for seamless magic link sign-in
- Dynamic versioning from git tags
- Pre-built native project via `expo prebuild`

### Observability

**End-to-end distributed tracing**:

- OpenTelemetry instrumentation (FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, logging)
- Client trace IDs propagated via WebSocket
- Full stack traces in error responses with trace_id references
- Debug endpoints for agent state, workspace files, and logs

### Code Quality

- **Python**: Strict mypy, ruff formatting, async/await throughout, Pydantic validation
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode, no `any` types, discriminated unions over runtime checks
- **Shared library**: Platform-agnostic code shared between React Native and web
- **Testing**: pytest + Jest with coverage reporting
