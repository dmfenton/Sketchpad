feat: Pen plotter motion mechanics

- Add travel paths between strokes (pen up, smooth diagonal movement)
- Add smoothstep easing for acceleration/deceleration curves
- Add pen settling delay after lowering (servo stabilization)
- Track pen position across strokes for continuous motion

Config: travel_speed_multiplier (2.0x), pen_settle_delay (50ms)
