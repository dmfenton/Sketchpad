"""End-to-end tests for Claude Agent SDK integration.

These tests make real API calls to verify SDK compatibility.
They catch breaking changes like parameter renames before production.

Run:
    make test-e2e-sdk

API key is loaded from SSM (production) or .env (local).
Cost: Uses claude-3-5-haiku (fastest/cheapest) with minimal prompts.
